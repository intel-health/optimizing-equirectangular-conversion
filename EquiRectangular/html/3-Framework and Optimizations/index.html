<h1>Execution Framework and Serial Code Optimizations</h1>

<p>
The previous blog, <a href="TODO insert URL here">Existing Open Source for 360 Degree Projection</a>, revealed that different implementations for converting an equirectangular image
into rectilinear view can take different amounts of time.  This blog post describes a framework that enables exploring of different techniques to optimize existing
open source options and determining how much faster an optimized algorithm can run and any tradeoffs needed for those optimizations.
</p>

<h2>Introducing a Code Framework for 360 Equirectangular Images</h2>

<p>
In order to test different algorithms for converting from an equirectangular to rectilinear image, the open source code generally has the following elements with some being optional
when testing how fast a specific algorithm functions:
<ul>
<li>Accept viewing parameters such as yaw, pitch, roll, viewport size, and algorithm(s) to be used when extracting an image</li>
<li>For each algorithm
<ul>
<li>Initialize the algorithm</li>
<li>For N iterations</li>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the pixel addresses to extract from the equirectangular image</li>
<li>Extract the pixel color from each of the addresses</li>
<li>Optional: Display the extracted image</li>
<li>Optional: Update viewing parameters for the next extraction either by automatically updating values or manually accepting input from the operator</li>
</ul>
<li>End For N iterations</li>
<li>Report timing information for the algorithm iterations</li>
</ul>
<li>End For each algorithm</li>
<li>Report summary statistics for the run</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The code found in the github repository <a href="https://github.com/intel-health/TODO-getfinallocation">OneDevice</a> implements the elements described above with some enhancements.  For instance,
some of the algorithms being tested take longer during the first iteration due to a need to compile a kernel or pass the kernel to an accelerator in the system such as a GPU.  In cases such as
video conversion, this "warmup iteration" happens at the very beginning and has a minor effect on the overall experience; however, for cases where the extraction happens on a single frame, 
this warmup time may be significant.  To help distinguish between these two situations, the framework separates out the first iteration as a "warmup iteration" and then takes the average 
of the remaining iterations.  This allows the operator to understand how the algorithm will perform for either single frames or a sequence of frames which could either be a video stream 
or changing as the operator moves the viewport around the scene.
</p>

<p>
The code that implements the psuedocode described above can be found in OptimizingEquirectangularConversion.cpp.  This file uses ParseArg.cpp to parse the command line parameters.  
Running the executable with the command line flag --help, -h, or -? prints out the full list of available flags and their default values.  
These can be used to configure the run and specify the algorithm(s) to use,
the initial viewing direction, the amount to change that direction with each iteration, the images to use, and so on.

<p>
The file TimingStats.cpp contains a class which can be called periodically as the code executes to capture the amount of time different steps in the algorithm take execute.
This class manages the warmup times, summing and averaging multiple iterations after warm up, and reporting out the information.
</p>

<p>
The framework includes a BaseAlgorithm.cpp that defines an abstract base class that has pure virtual functions indicating what the inheriting classes must implement so the framework can
call the algorithm implementations.  Aside from the constructor and destructor, the base class has functions for the following:
<ul>
<li> FrameCalculations - determine the pixel addresses for the frame</li>
<li> ExtractFrameImage - make a copy of the required pixels</li>
<li> GetDebugImage - return the equirectangular image with an outline of the frame that was calculated</li>
<li> GetDescription - provide a brief description of the algorithm</li>
<li> StartVariant - informs the algorithm to move to the next variation since some of the algorithms can be run in multiple ways (e.g., on CPU or on GPU)</li>
<li> StopVariant - informs the algorithm that the current variant is completing.  This allows variant cleanup such as releasing memory allocations</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The majority of the other files in the framework contain classes that derive from the base class above and implement various algorithms for extracting a rectilinear image from
an equirectangular image.  The following sections of this blog describe the algorithms.
</p>

<h2>Running the Framework in Interactive Mode</h2>

<p>
In order to assist with debugging and checking implemented algorithms for correct behaviors, the framework supports an interactive mode.  Placing the flag --iterations=0 on the command
line launches in interactive mode.  The framework initializes according to all other command line flags, runs the first algorithm, and then presents the rectilinear image in
a window.  The person running the code can interact using that window to change many of the parameters manually and the displayed image will update accordingly.  The framework
supports changing the yaw, pitch, and roll.  To provide maximum control, there is an internal "delta" value that determines how many degrees to move in a selected direction.  This
value is initialized to 10, but can be altered using keystrokes described below.
The accepted keys include:
<ul>
<li>
[#]Right arrow - add "delta" to the current yaw setting.  Optionally, if a positive or negative number is entered prior to hitting the right arrow, the "delta"
value is changed to the entered number and then applied when the right arrow is entered.  For example, 20 followed by right arrow will change the delta value to 20.
</li>
<li>[#]Left arrow - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is subtracted from the yaw.</li>
<li>[#]Up arrow - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is added to the pitch.</li>
<li>[#]Down arrow - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is subtracted from the pitch.</li>
<li>[#]PgUp - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is subtracted from the roll.</li>
<li>[#]PgDn - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is added to the roll.</li>
<li>[#]End - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is subtracted from the roll.</li>
<li>[#]Home - similar to right arrow except the "delta" value is added to the roll.</li>
<li>[#]* - similar to right arrow except the "delta" is subtracted from the field of view (fov).  The image zooms in.</li>
<li>[#]/ - similar to right arrow except the "delta" is added to the field of view (fov).  The image zooms out.</li>
<li>f - the image being displayed is changed to the other image (e.g., img0 to img1 or img1 to img0).</li>
<li>a - change the algorithm.  Enter a number from 0 - 11 before the a key to jump to that algorithm.</li>
<li>p - change the pitch to a given value.  Enter a number before the p key to jump to that pitch.</li>
<li>r - change the roll to a given value.  Enter a number from 0 - 11 before the r key to jump to that roll.</li>
<li>y - change the yaw to a given value.  Enter a number from 0 - 11 before the y key to jump to that yaw.</li>
<li>s - saves the currently displayed image to the current directory.</li>
<li>d - a debug window opens and for many algorithms the fov rectangle is shown superimposed on the underlying image.</li>
<li>q or Esc - exit the current variant of the algorithm and move on to the next.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Algorithm 0</h2>

<p>
The first algorithm utilizes the concepts from https://github.com/rfn123/equirectangular-to-rectlinear/blob/master/Equi2Rect.cpp and folds them into a derived class for the framework.
A code execution returns the output shown below.  The first line of the output shows the command that was used to produce the subsequent output.  The --algorithm=0 selects algorithm
zero to be used during the run.  The --iterations flag tells the program to run 101 total iterations with the first being a warmup and the remaining one hundred being for averaging the results.
The --yaw, --pitch, and --roll values define the initial viewport direction.  The --deltaYaw tells how many degrees to add to the viewport viewing direction with each new iteration so
iteration two will have a yaw of the initial 10 plus another 10 so it will point at 20 degrees to the right of center.  The next iteration will be 30 degrees and so on.
The --typePreference selects the processor to use for doing the calculations; however, note that for any algorithm that is not using Data Parallel C++, this flag is ignored.  The final
--img flags select the images to load.
</p>

<p>
The framework provides the ability to time different portions of a code run.  The warmup rows represent results from the first run of
the algorithm.  Sometimes this takes longer than subsequent runs due to allocating and initializing memory, selecting and compiling the correct kernel to run (discussed later), and
any other startup tasks.
</p>

<p>
The "times averaging" rows report the average of the remaining N-1 runs, in this case N = 1001.  By running multiple iterations, it smooths out the results since
it is possible that a single run may get swapped out in the middle of the calculation or take a bit longer than others as it executes.  Generally speaking, averaging a sufficiently
large number of iterations makes the results easier to compare and less susceptible to anomalies.
</p>

<p>
The "lap averaging" rows combine the warmup and times averaging to get the total picture of a run from start to finish across the full N iterations.  
</p>

<p>
All of the above averages uses the time within the function to compute an "instantaneous" FPS result that does not take into account any of the other logic outside the specific
computation functions.  The total averaging row takes the full execution time including all the supporting setup time and calculates the perceived FPS by the person operating the
code.  When everything is executing on a single device (CPU or GPU) the total averaging tends to be a lower FPS rate than the times averaging or the lap averaging since it takes longer
for the entire loop of code to run compared to the individual functions.  When code is executed on two devices which will be described later in the blog series, then the perceived
time may be shorter than the computational times since the computations on two devices happen in parallel.
</p>

<p>
The summary lines are repeats of the warmup and times averaging rows for summarizing the results of processing a frame of data.  They are repeated for convenience so the person executing
the code can quickly see the frame per second (FPS) results of the algorithm.
<p>

<p>
Notice that all rows are comma separated variables (CSV).  This makes it easy to copy/paste the results into a program like Excel to do further analysis.

<p>
As shown above, the framework supplies information about various stages of processing an image.  The Class initializtion times record the amount of time it takes to instantiate
the class that implements a particular algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Within the framework, each class implementing an algorithm may have different variants.  Think of these as minor variations on an algorithm that are being tested to see which
is more efficient.  For instance, variations may store data in memory differently such as array of structures, structure of arrays, row / column order, column / row order, and so on.
To support these variations, after class instantiation, the StartVariant is called for each variation.  The Variant initializations reports the amount of time it takes to do this initialization.
</p>

<p>
The Frame Calculations represent how long the algorithm spends in calculating the frame or the pixel locations to extract from the equirectangular image to create a rectilinear view
for a given viewing port.  In some cases, as is the case above, the algorithm does not pre-compute the frame information and, thus, the length of time is short.  But as shown later,
other algorithms do pre-compute the frame information and may cache this information to optimize for video streams or other cases where the viewing direction does not change, but the
underlying equirectangular image does change.
</p>

<p>
The Image extraction tells the amount of time it takes the algorithm to copy all the appropriate pixels from the equirectangular image into the new rectilinear image.
</p>

<p>
The frame(s) row reports how long it takes to do all the work to extract a frame.  This row also reports the maximum frame per second rate that could be achieved by this algorithm
assuming that nothing else was happening in the overall workflow.  Obviously, this is unrealistic in an actual workflow since the extracted image would need to be displayed to the
person using the program, but it gives a well defined metric to use when comparing the efficiency of one algorithm versus another.
</p>

<p>
The same Intel&reg; i9-9900k machine was used to execute the program as was used in the <a href="TODO link to blog 2">previous blog</a> that introduced this code.  The yellow highlighted
FPS (0.9273079) is approximately the same as the previous standalone results (0.89846216), so incorporating the code into the framework did not introduce substantial overhead.
</p>

<h2>Algorithm 1</h2>

<p>
The second algorithm ports the concepts from the Python code found in https://github.com/fuenwang/Equirec2Perspec/blob/master/Equirec2Perspec.py into a derived class for this framework.
In this case, two variations were created to test whether row / column or column / row layout is better.  Thus, the results shown below report on both variations.  The row/column layout
is faster by about 8 FPS.  This is primarily due to the fact that OpenCV represents images in row/column format thus storing results in column/row format in the algorithm forces an
additional step of transposing from column/row to row/column for the extraction phase.
</p>

<p>
For this algorithm, extra code was added to report on the amount of time the three key function calls take (Create XYZ Coords, Create Lon Lat Coords, and Create XY Coords) as well as
the extra Create Map step required to transpose the map.  As can be seen, the Create Map step in the second variant accounts for 1.77984 milliseconds on average, and this step alone 
accounts for the majority of the slowdown (i.e., if we take the overall frame time (16.79339) and subtract the Create Map time (1.77984), the frame time would take 
15.01355 which is similar to the row/column frame time of 14.82140 milliseconds for the first variant).
</p>

<p>
Comparing the FPS results below against the original Python results shows the C++ implementation to be about 5.7 times faster (i.e., 67.4700178 / 11.821199533998858).

<p>
Since Algorithm 1 pre-computes and stores the pixel address information for a given viewing direction, this information can be used to accelerate image
extraction for subsequent frames substantially, if the viewing direction does not change.  For instance, if the underlying frames come from a video or a person is
viewing a series of images and wishes to extract the same viewing direction from each, then this algorithm trades memory usage for speed.
</p>

<p>
In the output listed below, the --deltaYaw=10 was removed from the command line and --deltaImage was added.  The --deltaImage causes the framework to alternate each
extraction between --img0 and --img1 to simulate video or multiple stills with the same viewing direction.  As highlighted below, this increases
the FPS rate to 355.4009988 which is about 30 times faster than the original Python extraction speed for this specific usage scenario (i.e., 355.4009988 / 11.821199533998858).
</p>

<p>
Notice that the warmup iteration must include the Frame Calculations since that is where the pixel addresses are calculated, but for all the "times averaging" rows the time spent is 
miniscule (i.e., a function call and a set of comparisons to ensure the viewing direction has not changed).  If nothing has changed, then the already cached frame extraction coordinates
can be reused.

<p>
As shown below, Algorithm 2 replaces array indexing with code that gets the first pixel location and then increments the pointer once at the end of each loop versus computing the [x] offset three times
during the loop.

<p>
However, Algorithm 2 (67.5261480 FPS) performs about the same as Algorithm 1 (67.4700178 FPS).  See output below from Algorithm 2 (only the summary lines are presented for brevity).  
Either the multiple additions from Algorithm 1 computing the array index offset are inconsequential or the compiler optimizes this code properly.

<h2>Algorithm 3</h2>

<p>
Algorithm 3 resulted from exploring the code using the Intel&reg; Advisor tool which runs the executable and monitors the code's behavior.  Advisor has several profile settings
to provide: 1) a general survey, 2) characterization of trip counts, Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS), and call stacks, 3) memory access patterns, and/or 4) dependencies.
Advisor can profile an execution without making any modifications to the code; however, it also supports an API that allows a programmer to inform Advisor about code sections to profile.
</p>

<p>
The Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit 
(<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html</a>) 
includes Advisor.  Alternatively, a standalone version is available at 
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html#advisor">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html#advisor</a>.
Regardless of the selected download option, the tool is free.
</p>

<p>
Figure 1 below shows a screen capture from Advisor after profiling Algorithm 1 in Debug Mode.  The upper part of the figure contains the Roofline analysis.  There are three regions shown in different
shades of pink: 1) Memory bound functions and loops on the left, 2) Bound by computer and memory roofs in the center, and 3) Compute bound on the right.  Functions and loops falling in the Memory
region are throttled due to requiring memory access and the CPU remains capable of processing more data than can be provided by the memory accesses.  The central zone shows functions that may be
capped by memory accesses or by compute speed depending on which memory type of memory is being accessed (DRAM, Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 cache) and which instruction sets are being utilized
(Scaler Add, Vecotr Add, or Fused Multiply Add (FMA)).  The Compute bound zone receives plenty of data from appropriate memory sources and the CPU computational capabilities are the bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
Within the Roofline plot, each circle represents one of the loops or functions shown in the lower portion of the application.  Advisor categorizes each as: 1) Green if the code is not called 
a lot or if it is not taking a lot of processing time (i.e., the effort the optimize any of these will not result in large reductions in the overall time taken to compute an answer), 
2) Yellow dots represent code that merits taking a look at, but the gains will be lower than the red dots, 3) Red dots showcase code that would provide the maximum return on investment since
optimizing those elements provides the largest processing gains, if successful.
</p>

<p>
For each of the three regions in advisor, if a line is drawn directly upward, it will intersect with one or more lines above the dot.  Each of these lines represent either a type of memory
access (the diagonal lines) or a specific compute type (the horizontal lines).  To get above any of these lines, the code must be changed to take advantage of a different type of memory
access (to get above a diagonal line) or compute type (to get above a horizontal line).
</p>

<p>
The large red dot that has been selected in the figure below represents calls to cv::Mat::at which accesses elements within a 2D matrix.  Advisor explains that the performance is currently 
at 3.5 GigaOPS.  If the function could utilize more data from the L3 cache, it could execute at a maximum of 29.87 GigaOPS; whereas, if L1 cache could be utilized, it would jump up to 
186.4 GigaOPS.  Notice that the scale of both axis of the Roofline graph are logarithmic so moving further up or right makes significant gains.

<p>
One option would be to investigate improving the performance of the at function; however, that code resides in the OpenCV code base so making changes there would be harder.  Thus,
for this coding effort the code was reviewed to see if the number of calls to the "at" function could be reduced.  Within Algorithm 1 (and 2), the code calling the "at" function looks like 
the following.  Since the 9 calls to "at" are inside a double loop, each one is called m_heightOutput * m_widthOutput times.  The code run through Advisor was configured to have the width
at 1080 and height at 540 resulting in 1080 * 540 * 9 = 5,248,800 calls to "at".

<p>
Given the m_rotationMatrix does not change values during the execution of ConvertXYZToLonLat function, the
solution implemented in Algorithm 3 pulls those 9 calls to "at" outside the loops and gathers the 9 values in local variables a single time before the loops.
This results in the following code snippet.  The compiler can then keep these values in registers or cache so the code performs more efficiently.

<h2>Algorithm 4</h2>

<p>
Algorithm 4 optimizes Algorithm 3 by refactoring the FrameCalculations to combine the three separate calls to ComputeXYZCoords, ComputeLonLatCoords, and ComputeXYCoords into a single
function.  Each of the three functions had internal double loops and the computed values from each of those loops were used in subsequent loops.  By combining everything into a single
function, the data computations tend to stay in registers or cache memory.  Determining why each step in the function occurs may be slightly more difficult, but that can be relieved by
good code comments.  As shown below, these code changes result in nearly a 20% improvement in speed (170.4878797 / 142.8002410 = 1.19389).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This blog introduced a framework for exploring different optimization techniques and discussed ways to increase the frames per second throughput including: 
1) porting an speedy algorithm from Python to C++ and saving the pixel addresses from frame to frame, 2) optimizing array accesses, 3) reducing computational load
by not calling the cv::Mat::at() function many times within a loop, and 4) combining separate loops into a single master loop.  The combined improvements resulted
in moving from 0.9273079 FPS to 170.4878797 FPS for a 183 times improvement.
</p>

<p>
In the next blog further improvements will be explored by converting the code from single thread processing to parallel processing.
